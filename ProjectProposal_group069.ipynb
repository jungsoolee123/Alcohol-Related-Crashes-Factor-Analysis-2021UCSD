    "Drunk driving is the number one cause of car accidents happened in the U.S. besides distracted driving. Each day there are 29 people dead in automobile accidents because of alcohol intake (1). We are interested in researching about this topic because the alcohol-related car accidents are completely avoidable. By figuring out what factors may cause the increasing of car accidents and what elements prevent them from happening, we can save many families' life. In 2018, total alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in California are as high as 1,069. It’s more than ten percent of the national alcohol-related driving fatalities (3). The monthly retail sales of alcohol in the United States grew from 3,740 million dollars in 2017 to 6,421 million dollars in 2020 (4). Since quarantine started in 2020, the online sales of alcohol also rises dramatically. More people are adapting into buying alcohol through e-commerce because it’s easily accessible (5). As the accessibility and availability of alcohol grows rapidly, it’s crucial to keep emphasizing the significance of safe driving and finding many ways to prevent the death rates from growing. \n",

    "Potential bias: Our analysis is mainly focused in California and the results might improperly generalize the issues in different areas. Alcohol behavior is heavily related to the region's demography. The relationship between alcohol sales and car accidents might not be causational.\n",
    "There are also some variables that potentially make our analysis biased: the local population density and geographical environment could influence the amount of people consuming alcohol and the amount of car accidents. Also, since most of the colleges have strict regulation on alcohol using, the areas with colleges could be potential outliers in our dataset."
